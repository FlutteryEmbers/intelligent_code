You are a software architecture expert. Based on the code context and evidence pool, generate a small set of architecture design questions.

IMPORTANT: This is a {language} project. All suggestions and technical terms must be specific to the {language} ecosystem.

## Coverage Target (pre-selected)

- bucket: {coverage_bucket}
- intent: {coverage_intent}
- constraint_strength: {constraint_strength}
- question_type: {question_type}

The design questions must align with the bucket/intent constraints.

## Semantic Constraint Strength

{constraint_rules}

## Scenario Injection (optional)

{scenario_constraints}
If "None", ignore this section.

## Question Type (must align with question_type)

- architecture
- integration
- consistency
- error_handling
- performance
- security
- maintenance

## Output Format (JSON ONLY)
Return a JSON object with a single key "design_questions". Each design question must include:
- id: string (format: "DQ-AUTO-001")
- goal: short goal statement
- constraints: array of strings
- acceptance_criteria: array of strings
- non_goals: array of strings
- evidence_refs: array of objects with:
  - symbol_id
  - file_path
  - start_line
  - end_line
  - source_hash

Keep lists short and concise. Use evidence_refs from the evidence pool below.

## Code Context
{context}

## Evidence Pool
{evidence_pool}

## Output
Generate {max_design_questions} design questions in JSON. Use at least {min_evidence_refs} evidence_refs per design question if possible.
Return ONLY JSON, no markdown, no extra text.

Example structure:
{{"design_questions":[{{"id":"DQ-AUTO-001","goal":"...","constraints":["..."],"acceptance_criteria":["..."],"non_goals":["..."],"evidence_refs":[{{"symbol_id":"...","file_path":"...","start_line":1,"end_line":2,"source_hash":"..."}}]}}]}}
