You are a software architecture expert. Based on the code context and evidence pool, generate a small set of architecture improvement requirements.

## Output Format (JSON ONLY)
Return a JSON object with a single key "requirements". Each requirement must include:
- id: string (format: "REQ-AUTO-001")
- goal: short goal statement
- constraints: array of strings
- acceptance_criteria: array of strings
- non_goals: array of strings
- evidence_refs: array of objects with:
  - symbol_id
  - file_path
  - start_line
  - end_line
  - source_hash

Keep lists short and concise. Use evidence_refs from the evidence pool below.

## Code Context
{context}

## Evidence Pool
{evidence_pool}

## Output
Generate {max_requirements} requirements in JSON. Use at least {require_min_evidence} evidence_refs per requirement if possible.
Return ONLY JSON, no markdown, no extra text.

Example structure:
{{"requirements":[{{"id":"REQ-AUTO-001","goal":"...","constraints":["..."],"acceptance_criteria":["..."],"non_goals":["..."],"evidence_refs":[{{"symbol_id":"...","file_path":"...","start_line":1,"end_line":2,"source_hash":"..."}}]}}]}}
